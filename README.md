## Development Workflow

Quick Info:

- All PRs to `develop` and `master` require 1 approver and a passing build.
- There should be no commits to master pushed. All changes should be submitted through a PR.
- The `develop` branch contains the full history of the source code. 
- Feature branches should be based on `develop`; use `git checkout -b myFeatureBranch develop`.
- Once your feature is complete please submit a PR to `develop`. The only direct commits to `develop` should be small (such as a bug fix).
